## About

A web extension for:

- **Pruning those old bookmarks** you told yourself you'd read on the weekend, _two years ago_.
- **Rediscovering** interesting content lost to bookmark oblivion.
- Or just **aimlessly navigating** your bookmark collection.

### How to use

1. **Load a random bookmark:** Use either the extension's popup panel or the keyboard shortcut (default is `Ctrl + Shift + Y`)
2. **Prune or keep:** Decide if you'll keep the bookmark, or if it's time to remove it from your collection.
3. **Repeat:** Load the next random bookmark and keep on pruning.

If you wish, you can **change the root folder** to restrict which bookmarks are selected by the extension. This setting is available in the popup panel.
